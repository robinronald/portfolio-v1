If some thing is missing they can easily find out what type of product it is and to whom that product is shown. So if the product is stolen by any person it can be verified and find out the theft by viewing them in CCTV SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. and the footage is sent to the police and further action is taken by them. It also shows what are the product needed and what are the products not needed.</p>
